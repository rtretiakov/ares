# Node Documentation
ares emulation cores are based around a tree concept: rather than have a single flat API that tries to capture the nuance of every supported system, each core is instead constructed from a tree of node objects, where each node provides its own API. In this way, any additional functionality can be added to the tree on an as-needed basis.

Each Node object is reference-counted as a shared_pointer, and contains functionality to enumerate and serialize its child nodes. An attribute system is also used to allow a user interface layer to add any metadata to the nodes that it finds useful.

Nodes are the glue-logic between the emulation core and the user interface. An unfortunate side-effect of this is that the full API of each node is exposed to both, even though some functions are only meant to be called by the emulation cores, and others only by the user interface. To address this, API functions meant to be used only by the emulation core are marked with core, functions meant to be used only by the user interface are marked with user, and functions allowed to be used by both are marked with both.

### load
```
user load(Node::System& node, string name) -> bool;
```
A single function is needed to construct a new tree for any given system, and so every core in ares exposes this function in its namespace (for instance, ares::MasterSystem::load() for the ms core.)

The node passed to load() is an output parameter (it is written to and not read from, thus it does not need to be initialized.) The name passed allows a single core to support multiple hardware variants (for example, "Master System" or "Game Gear" for the ms core.) The name is needed even for cores that only support a single hardware configuration.

Frontends need only include <ares/ares.hpp> and then forward declare the load() function to be able to fully control each emulation core.

This function returns true if the core was successfully loaded. A return value of false means that the startup sequence should be aborted here.

Setting nodes are used to expose user-configurable values: things such as the desired processor revision to emulate, the region the system should identify as, whether to display the video overscan area or not, etc.

Some settings are safe to change at any time even while the system is running, such as the overscan settings; while others are only safe to be modified at certain key events, such as the system region only during power-on.

To facilitate this, the Setting nodes contain both the currently assigned value as well as the latched value. Settings that can be changed at any time are set to be dynamic. When a setting is not dynamic, only the current value is changed. When a setting is dynamic, both the current value and latched values are changed. The emulation cores call latch() to copy the current value to the latched value when they are able to, and read out the latched value for emulation purposes.

Often times only certain values are allowed for a given setting, such as a region setting exposing only "NTSC" and "PAL", for example. The cores will set the allowed values, and the user interface can use these values to show the available settings. If a list of allowed values are set, attempting to change the current value to a value not in the list will fail.

A modify callback is provided for the emulation cores, so that they can be notified when the latched value has been modifed by the user interface in order to react. For instance, toggling the overscan area would result in the emulation core adjusting the video screen size as needed.
